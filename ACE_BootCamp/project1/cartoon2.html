    <h3>About</h3>  
    <p>Mr. Bean (also known as Mr. Bean: The Animated Series) is an animated sitcom produced by Tiger Aspect Productions in association with Richard Purdum Productions and Varga Holdings (for the first three series). Based on the 1990â€“1995 British live-action television sitcom of the same name created by Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson, the series centres on Mr. Bean (voiced by the latter), Teddy, Irma Gobb and the Reliant Regal's mysterious driver, with the addition of new characters such as Bean's landlady Mrs. Wicket and her disobedient cat Scrapper. In February 2001, the series was officially announced.</p><br>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Debuting on 5 January 2002 and originally ending on 2 June 2004, three series and 52 episodes were broadcast, each consisting of two 11-minute segments. The first two series were originally broadcast on ITV1 at a prime time Saturday night slot. In May 2004, the series left ITV1 and the third series was instead broadcast daily on CITV due to the show's popularity with younger audiences. In January 2014, CITV announced a revival of the series with Rowan Atkinson returning as the voice of Mr. Bean, along with other cast members reprising their roles. The revival featured two series and 78 new episodes; the new episodes began airing from 16 February 2015.[4] The revival contained more actual dialogue than in the original series, which mostly featured little sound effects and mumbling. The series was also aired as part of Cartoon Network's Sunday Pants.</p>
