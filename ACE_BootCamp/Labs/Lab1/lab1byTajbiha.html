    <p>Hello, I am Tajbiha(Taj).I am doing my last semester in QCC
       and excited to start my new semester in Baruch College. Before
       taking this Software Eng. Micro-Credential course I took one
       more Micro-Credential course in Data Analytics in the beginning
       of this year. Taking these Micro-Credential course will help me
       know, which sector of Information Technology I'm interested in
       and best suited for me. The reason why I'm talking this course
       is, It gives me opportunites to explore all the sector of
       Information Technology.</p>
